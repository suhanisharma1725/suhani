<h1><u>Stunning Landscapes</u></h1>
<h3><b>Varied Geography:</b></h3> From the majestic Himalayas to the serene backwaters of Kerala and the sandy deserts of Rajasthan, India offers a diverse range of landscapes.The first aspect of nature’s beauty that I will explore is its diverse landscapes. From the vast forests of the Amazon to the towering mountains of the Himalayas, nature presents us with a breathtaking array of landscapes. The oceans and deserts, too, have their unique beauty, with the former offering an endless expanse of water, and the latter providing a stark and arid landscape that is both unforgiving and beautiful. Each of these landscapes offers its unique beauty, and it is impossible not to be amazed by the incredible diversity of nature.<div><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP._6BZD2sIuV0K7175o5yMawAAAA?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain" height="600px"  width="600"px></div>

<h3><b>Beautiful Beaches:</b></h3> The coastline of Goa and the Andaman & Nicobar Islands offer stunning beaches and pristine waters.A beach is a magical place where land meets the sea. It’s a place filled with golden sand that feels warm and soft under your feet. The waves of the sea come and go, leaving behind pretty seashells and sometimes, tiny crabs scuttle around. The sea can be calm, its water clear and blue, where you can see small fish swimming near the shore. Sometimes, the sea is wild and the waves are big and strong. On sunny days, the beach is bright and hot, perfect for building sandcastles or playing games. You can also sit under a big umbrella to read a book or take a nap. On the beach, you can see beautiful birds like seagulls and pelicans flying overhead. As the sun sets, the beach becomes a beautiful painting of orange and pink. <div><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.968ef696022ee7f7fe91505c785ccd65?rik=hYF1g7guBr4FYA&riu=http%3a%2f%2fcdn.wallpapersafari.com%2f87%2f15%2fpmqPeh.jpg&ehk=uo75zbohQEu%2bj24YS5E5lEyQ9Bz8stCepGdFaGN%2bHG8%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0" height="600px" width="600px"></div>

<b>Across the entire Rajasthan, Jaipur is known to be the biggest city. It is also popularly called the Pink City.

The variety of forts and palaces showcase the exciting history of Jaipur. This city was formed by the Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II know as a great warrior in the ancient times.

Although initially the capital of Rajasthan used to be Amber but considering the safety viewpoint, the capitals were changed later on.

This city has been trendy amongst the visitors since earlier times, due to the availability of several famous hotels.

            <li> <h3>Kerala Backwaters<h3> <br>


The Kerala backwaters are a network of brackish lagoons and canals lying parallel to the Arabian Sea of the Malabar coast of Kerala state in south-western India. It also includes interconnected lakes, rivers, and inlets, a labyrinthine system formed by more than 900 km (560 mi) of waterways, and sometimes compared to bayous.[3] The network includes five large lakes linked by canals, both man made and natural, fed by 38 rivers, and extending virtually half the length of Kerala state. The backwaters were formed by the action of waves and shore currents creating low barrier islands across the mouths of the many rivers flowing down from the Western Ghats range. In the midst of this landscape there are a number of towns and cities, which serve as the starting and end points of backwater cruises.[4] There are 34 backwaters in Kerala.[5] Out of it, 27 are located either closer to Arabian Sea or parallel to the sea.[5] The remaining 7 are inland navigation routes.[5]

The backwaters have a unique ecosystem: freshwater from the rivers meets the seawater from the Arabian Sea. A barrage has been built near Thanneermukkom, so salt water from the sea is prevented from entering the deep inside, keeping the fresh water intact. Such fresh water is extensively used for irrigation purposes.[6][7] Many unique species of aquatic life including crabs, frogs and mudskippers, water birds such as terns, kingfishers, darters and cormorants, and animals such as otters and turtles live in and alongside the backwaters. Palm trees, pandanus shrubs, various leafy plants, and bushes grow alongside the backwaters, providing a green hue to the surrounding landscape.[7]</li>
            <li><h3>Goa Beaches<h3> <br>
Goa is a small state located on the west coast of India. It is famous for its beautiful beachs.The gods smiled on Goa. They blessed this sun-kissed strip of the Indian coast with warm winter weather, whispering palms, fine food and friendly people, then garnished the dish with a string of sandy beaches, creating an almost unbroken strip of gold from Arambol to Polem. But with so many beaches to choose from, where to begin?

Whether you’re after unspoiled golden shores, morning yoga classes under the palms or the last embers of the full-moon-flavoured hippy vibe that made the region so (in)famous, there’s a stretch of sand suited to you. Here’s our guide to Goa’s best beaches.There’s more to Goan food than vindaloo, though a well-prepared version of this Portuguese-Indian fusion dish flavoured with palm vinegar and dried red chilli is still a delight on the palateEscaping the crowds can be tricky in Goa – the beaches are obviously no secret – but it can be done; the trick is to go to the end of the line. So far north it’s almost in Maharashtra, Querim, aka Keri Beach, lies beyond the radar of the legions who congregate in Baga, Calangute and Candolim.</li>
            <li><h3>Himalayas<h3><br>
</li>
<b>The Himalayan Mountains are also known as the Himadri, Himavan or Himachal. The Himalayas consist of the youngest and the loftiest mountain chains in the world.

The magnitude of their size can be estimated from the fact that the central axial range of the main Himalayas alone stretches for a distance of over 2,400 km (over 22° longitude) from the Indus gorge in the west to the Brahmaputra gorge in the east.

The width of the Himalayas varies from 500 km in Kashmir to 200 km in Arunachal Pradesh. The total area of the Himalayan mountain region is nearly five lakh sq km. The Pamir, popularly known as the roof of the world is the connecting link between the Himalayas and the high ranges of Central Asia. The Himalayan mountain chains have the lofties peaks of the world. The number of peaks higher than 8,000 metre is 14 and those over 7,500 metre total 20. Of the 94 Asian peaks which exceed 7,300 metre, all but two are in the Himalaya and Karakoram ranges. The number of peaks over 7,000 metre runs into hundreds and several peaks above 6000 metre have not been adequately counted and mapped. Many of them have not been even given their names till now.       
Everest which is a part of the Himalayas is the highest mountain peak in the world. It lies in Nepal Tenzing and Hillary were the first persons who scaled this peak in 1953. Since then, it has been scaled by several men and women of different countries.


India has a great advantage of the Himalayas which lie to her north. For one thing, they protect the Indians plains from the austerity of intensely cold winds from China that would otherwise blow over them.


The Himalayas are very high. So, they are always covered with a thick layer of snow which melts partially in summer. Thus, all the major rivers of India like the Ganga, the Yamuna, the Sutlej, the Beas and the Brahmputra flow to the Indian plains from the glaciers situated in the Himalayas.</b></ul>

Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent. Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits.

Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hinduism and Islam, cultural choices and traditions.[1][2] Historical events such as invasions, trade relations, and colonialism have played a role in introducing certain foods to India. The Columbian discovery of the New World brought a number of new vegetables and fruits. A number of these such as potatoes, tomatoes, chillies, peanuts, and guava have become staples in many regions of India.[3]

Indian cuisine has shaped the history of international relations; the spice trade between India and Europe was the primary catalyst for Europe's Age of Discovery.[4] Spices were bought from India and traded around Europe and Asia. Indian cuisine has influenced other cuisines across the world, especially those from Europe (Britain in particular), the Middle East, Southern African, East Africa, Southeast Asia, North America, Mauritius, Fiji, Oceania, and the Caribbean.
Indian cuisine is known for its large assortment of dishes1. It consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent2. Each regional cuisine uses its own locally grown herbs, spices, fruits and vegetables, and the cooking style varies from region to region31. The staple Indian foods are rice, wheat and lentils, and no Indian dish is complete without spices.</p>
